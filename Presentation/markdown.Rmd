## Introduction

### What are Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (SSBs)?
* soft drinks, energy drinks, fruit nectar drinks etc.
* one of the main sources of added sugar intake in Germany
* many associated health issues, that lead to decrease life quality of individual people and are also a burden on the public health system

### And why should they be taxed?
* to internalize the external costs of high sugar consumption for the society
* higher prices of SSBs lead to lower consumption: proven for several countries
  + a 10% tax levied against SSBs has been shown to lead to an 8-10% reduction in purchase and consumption
  + a 20% tax on SSBs has been demonstrated to reduce the prevalence of overweight by 1-3% and the prevalence of obesity by 1-4%
  + SSB taxes can significantly reduce the incidence of type-2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and premature mortality
  + SSB taxes have resulted in substantial increases in government revenue
  + no evidence of negative impact on employment was found (UNICEF (2022))
* tax returns can be reinvested in health sector, further promoting health and well-being of the population
* alternative interventions to reduce sugar consumption on the individual and producer/retailer level often show effects slower and are more costly; they are still useful to accompany a tax introduction 
* recommended by WHO and UNICEF because

### Why did we choose Germany?
* Germany doesn’t have this kind of tax at the moment
* officially because “there is not enough scientifical evidence yet that a tax on SBBs will decrease sugar or total energy intake of the population in the long term and/or decrease obesity”  
*Source: https://www.bundestag.de/webarchiv/presse/hib/2020_12/810910-810910*
* Instead, Germany has a national strategy (NRI, 2019-25) including the reduction of sugar contents of heavily processed food/drinks and awareness raising campaigns

## Decision 

**Decision:** Introducing a tax on SSBs in Germany

**Decision maker:** German government

### Underlying assumptions of the model
* higher prices lead to lower consumption of SSBs
  + important to declare the tax separately on the label and explain about negative health consequences to make the tax more effective
  + awareness raising campaigns and public information also important
  + some people might feel patronized and consume even more
* lower consumption of SSBs leads to lower consumption of sugar
  + people might substitute with other sugar-rich products


## Modeling 
### Model with a broad approach
In our overall decision model, we are interested to look at the effect of implementation of Tax in SSB products. We assumed that this decision to implement the tax in SSB products will have effect in different economic, ecologic, social and health factors.  From economic point of view, implementation of SSB tax might decrease the interest of farmers in sugar beet cultivation and which may ultimately leads to decreased sugar beets production.  But from ecological perspectives reduced in sugar beet cultivation area might provide opportunity to increase the areas for sustainable cultivations. Also, cultivation of sugar beets for longer period was found to be deleterious to soil health so, decreased in sugar beets area might help to regain soil health. Whereas in social aspect, SSB tax can be a demonstration for people to reduce sugar consumption. But it might be questionable about the access of such products among rich and poor people.

In our model we assumed that, SSB tax might have greater effects in term of health as tax might reduced the consumption of sugar and leading to decrease sugar related health diseases like diabetes and obesity. And also for our model we will focus only on the health sector as it is one of the important aspect and we may not be able to look all the aspect due to limitation of finding data in defined timeframe of our study. 



### Model for Decision Analysis
Our decision model will be based on how much German government can save or lose after implementation or no implementation of SSB Tax respectively. In our model we will try to see the effect of decision after 10 years. To implement the tax government will need to bear the administration cost, production cost and public information cost in the first year. Then for each successive year, it will need maintenance cost to keep the tax on going. So, the administration, production, public information and maintenance costs will be the total implementation cost for the government to implement the tax.  On the other hand, after implementation of the tax, government will generate revenue which will account as benefit to government. Also, we supposed that tax intervention will reduced in the amount of consumption of such products leading to low sugar consumption in individual. This will ultimately reduced the some serious health cases like diabetes, obesity and cancer so, it will help to reduce the health care cost of the government. This will also be benefit to the government.

At the end, the total NPV will be calculated based on these costs and benefits which will help us to decide weather to implement or not implement sugar tax.
