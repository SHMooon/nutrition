# Description from https://www.reddit.com/r/RStudio/comments/g49gu0/r_markdown_knitropts_chunksetecho_true/
# Having knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) in a chunk at the beginning of your document is the same of having ````{r echo = TRUE}` for all chunks.
# You can also use it for setting other configs, like echo, eval, include and others
